# CS50
Harvard CS50x - 2021

Due to CS50's Academic Honesty Policy, I cannot share my lab or problem set solutions for this course:

`Not Reasonable:`
* `Providing or making available solutions to assessments to individuals who might take this course in the future.`
* `Submitting work to this course that you intend to use outside of the course (e.g., for a job) without prior approval from the courseâ€™s heads.`

### Due to the policy, I will instead just include my final project for the course when it's done (maybe)
### I will also include my certificate of completion when received.
